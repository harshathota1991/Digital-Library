		<p> Digital Library originated from the idea that there exists a class of readers who respond better to online content and prefer 
		to learn new skills at their own pace from the comforts of their drawing rooms.</p>
<p>Our content and resources are freely available and we prefer to keep it that way to encourage our readers acquire as many skills as they would like to.
 We donâ€™t force our readers to sign up with us or submit their details either. No preconditions and no impediments. Simply Easy Learning!</p>
