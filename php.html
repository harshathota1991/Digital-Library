		<p>PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language.
		As of January 2013, PHP was installed on more than 240 million websites (39% of those sampled) and 2.1 million web servers.
		Originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, the reference implementation of PHP (powered by the Zend Engine)
		is now produced by The PHP Group.While PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, it now stands for PHP: 
		Hypertext Preprocessor, which is a recursive backronym.
PHP code can be simply mixed with HTML code, or it can be used in combination with various template engines and web frameworks.
 PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter, which is usually implemented as a web server's native module or a Common Gateway Interface 
 (CGI) executable. After the PHP code is interpreted and executed, the web server sends resulting output to its client, 
 usually in form of a part of the generated web page; for example, PHP code can generate a web page's HTML code, an image, or some other data.
 PHP has also evolved to include a command-line interface (CLI) capability and can be used in standalone graphical applications.

<h1 style="color:#151B54;" > Installation and configuration </h1><hr><br>
	

<p>There are two primary ways for adding support for PHP to a web server â€“ as a native web server module, 
or as a CGI executable. PHP has a direct module interface called Server Application Programming Interface (SAPI), which is supported by many web servers
 including Apache HTTP Server, Microsoft IIS, Netscape (now defunct) and iPlanet. Some other web servers, such as OmniHTTPd, support the Internet Server
 Application Programming Interface (ISAPI), which is a Microsoft's web server module interface. If PHP has no module support for a web server,
 it can always be used as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) or FastCGI processor; in that case, the web server is configured to use PHP's CGI executable
 to process all requests to PHP files. </p>

<p>PHP development began in 1994 when Rasmus Lerdorf wrote a series of Common Gateway Interface (CGI) binaries in C,
3] which he used to maintain his personal homepage. He extended them to add the ability to work with web forms and to 
communicate with databases, and called this implementation "Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter" or PHP/FI.

PHP/FI could be used to build simple, dynamic web applications. Lerdorf initially announced the release of PHP/FI as
 "Personal Home Page Tools (PHP Tools) version 1.0" publicly to accelerate bug location and improve the code, on the Usenet discussion group comp.
 This release already had the basic functionality that PHP has as of 2013. This included Perl-like variables, form handling, and the ability to embed HTML.
 The syntax resembled that of Perl but was simpler, more limited and less consistent. </p>
