		<p>Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language.
		Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer
		lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java.
		The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.
		Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles. 
		It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive standard library.
		

Python interpreters are available for installation on many operating systems,
 allowing Python code execution on a wide variety of systems. Using third-party tools, such as Py2exe or Pyinstaller,
 Python code can be packaged into stand-alone executable programs for some of the most popular operating systems,
 allowing for the distribution of Python-based software for use on those environments without requiring the installation of a Python interpreter.

CPython, the reference implementation of Python, is free and open-source software and has a community-based development model,
 as do nearly all of its alternative implementations. CPython is managed by the non-profit Python Software Foundation.

<h1 style="color:#151B54;" > Overview </h1><hr><br>
	

<p>Python is a multi-paradigm programming language: object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported,
 and there are a number of language features which support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including by metaprogramming
 and by magic methods). Many other paradigms are supported using extensions, including design by contract and logic programming.

Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management.
 An important feature of Python is dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.

The design of Python offers only limited support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. 
The language has map(), reduce() and filter() functions; comprehensions for lists, dictionaries, and sets; as well as generator expressions.
 The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML</p>

<p>Python was conceived in the late 1980s and its implementation was started in December 1989 by Guido van Rossum at CWI
 in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL) capable of exception handling and interfacing with
 the Amoeba operating system. Van Rossum is Python's principal author, and his continuing central role in deciding the direction of Python
 is reflected in the title given to him by the Python community, benevolent dictator for life (BDFL).

About the origin of Python, Van Rossum wrote in 1996.</p>
