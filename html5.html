		<h1 style="color:#151B54;" > About HTML 5  </h1><br>	
		<p>HTML5 is a core technology markup language of the Internet used for structuring and presenting content for the World Wide Web.
		As of October 2014 this is the final and complete fifth revision of the HTML standard of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
		The previous version, HTML 4, was standardised in 1997. Its core aims have been to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia 
		while keeping it easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices (web browsers, parsers, etc.).
		HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML. Following its immediate predecessors HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.1,
		HTML5 is a response to the fact that the HTML and XHTML in common use on the World Wide Web are a mixture of features introduced by
		various specifications, along with those introduced by software products such as web browsers, those established by common practice.
		It is also an attempt to define a single markup language that can be written in either HTML or XHTML. It includes detailed processing
		models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, improves and rationalises the markup available for documents, and introduces
		markup and application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications.
		For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a potential candidate for cross-platform mobile applications. Many features of HTML5 have been
		built with the consideration of being able to run on low-powered devices such as smartphones and tablets.

<h3 style="color:#151B54;" > Markup </h3><br>
<p>
HTML5 introduces elements and attributes that reflect typical usage on modern websites.
 Some of them are semantic replacements for common uses of generic block (div) and inline (span) elements, for example (nav) (website navigation block),
 footer (usually referring to bottom of web page or to last lines of HTML code), or audio and (video) instead of (object).
 Some deprecated elements from HTML 4.01 have been dropped, including purely presentational elements such as (font) and (center),
 whose effects have long been superseded by the more capable Cascading Style Sheets.
 There is also a renewed emphasis on the importance of DOM scripting (e.g., JavaScript) in Web behavior.</p>	
		<br><br>
	<h3 style="color:#151B54;" > New APIs </h3><br>
<p>
In addition to specifying markup, HTML5 specifies scripting application programming interfaces (APIs) that can be used with JavaScript.
 Existing document object model (DOM) interfaces are extended and the features documented. There are also new APIs, such as:
<ul>
<li><p>Timed media playback.</p></li>
<li><p>Offline Web Applications.</p></li>
<li><p>Document editing.</p></li>
<li><p>Drag-and-drop.</p></li>
<li><p>Browser history management.</p></li>
</ul>
