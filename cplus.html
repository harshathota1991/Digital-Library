		<h1 style="color:#151B54;" > About C++  </h1><br>	
		<p>C++  is a general-purpose programming language.
		It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing the facilities for low-level memory manipulation.

It is designed with a bias toward system programming, with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design requirements.
 C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, 
including desktop applications, servers, performance-critical applications 
, and entertainment software. C++ is a compiled language, 
with implementations of it available on many platforms and provided by various organizations, including the FSF, LLVM, Microsoft and Intel.</p>
<p>Many other programming languages have been influenced by C++, including C#, Java, and newer versions of C.</p>
		
	<br><br>
<h1 style="color:#151B54;" > Compatibility </h1><br>	
<p> Producing a reasonably standards-compliant C++ compiler has proven to be a difficult task for compiler vendors in general.
 For many years, different C++ compilers implemented the C++ language to different levels of compliance to the standard, and their 
 implementations varied widely in some areas such as partial template specialization.
 Recent releases of most popular C++ compilers support almost all of the C++ 1998 standard.</p>
 	<br><br>
	<h1 style="color:#151B54;" > Philosophy </h1><br>		
<p>	It must be driven by actual problems and its features should be useful immediately in real world programs. 
Every feature should be implementable (with a reasonably obvious way to do so). Programmers should be free to pick their own programming style,
 and that style should be fully supported by C++. Allowing a useful feature is more important than preventing every possible misuse of C++. 
 It should provide facilities for organizing programs into well-defined separate parts, and provide facilities for combining separately developed parts.
 No implicit violations of the type system (but allow explicit violations that have been explicitly asked for by the programmer). 
 Make user created types have equal support and performance to build in types. Any features that you do not use you do not pay for (e.g. in performance). 
 There should be no language beneath C++. C++ should work alongside other pre-existing programming languages, rather than being part of its own separate and incompatible programming environment.
 If what the programmer wants to do is unknown, allow the programmer to specify (provide manual control).</p>
