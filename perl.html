		<p>Perl is a family of high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming languages. 
		The languages in this family include Perl 5 and Perl 6. Though Perl is not officially an acronym,
there are various backronyms in use, the most well-known being "Practical Extraction and Reporting Language".
 Perl was originally developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing easier.
 Since then, it has undergone many changes and revisions. Perl 6, which began as a redesign of Perl 5 in 2000, eventually evolved into a 
 separate language. Both languages continue to be developed independently by different development teams and liberally borrow ideas from one another.

The Perl languages borrow features from other programming languages including C, shell scripting (sh), AWK, and sed.
 They provide powerful text processing facilities without the arbitrary data-length limits of many contemporary Unix commandline tools,
 facilitating easy manipulation of text files. Perl 5 gained widespread popularity in the late 1990s as a CGI scripting language, 
 in part due to its unsurpassed
 regular expression and string parsing abilities.

In addition to CGI, Perl 5 is used for graphics programming, system administration,
 network programming, finance, bioinformatics, and other applications. It has been nicknamed "the Swiss Army chainsaw of scripting languages" 
 because of its flexibility and power, and possibly also because of its "ugliness". In 1998, it was also referred to as the "duct tape that holds
 the Internet together", in reference to both its ubiquitous use as a glue language and its perceived inelegance.

<p>The overall structure of Perl derives broadly from C. Perl is procedural in nature, with variables, 
expressions, assignment statements, brace-delimited blocks, control structures, and subroutines.

Perl also takes features from shell programming. All variables are marked with leading sigils, which allow variables to be interpolated 
directly into strings. However, unlike the shell, Perl uses sigils on all accesses to variables, and unlike most other programming languages
 that use sigils, the sigil doesn't denote the type of the variable but the type of the expression. So for example, to access a list of values in a hash, 
 the sigil for an array ("@") is used, not the sigil for a hash ("%"). 
 Perl also has many built-in functions that provide tools often used in shell programming
 (although many of these tools are implemented by programs external to the shell) such as sorting, and calling on operating system facilities.

Perl takes lists from Lisp, hashes ("associative arrays") from AWK, and regular expressions from sed. These simplify and facilitate many parsing, 
text-handling, and data-management tasks. Also shared with Lisp are the implicit return of the last value in a block, and the fact that all 
statements have a value, and thus are also expressions and can be used in larger expressions themselves.

Perl 5 added features that support complex data structures, first-class functions (that is, closures as values), 
and an object-oriented programming model. These include references, packages, class-based method dispatch, and lexically scoped variables,
 along with compiler directives (for example, the strict pragma). A major additional feature introduced with Perl 5 was the ability to package 
 code as reusable modules. Wall later stated that "The whole intent of Perl 5's module system was to encourage the growth of Perl culture rather
 than the Perl core." </p>

<p>Larry Wall began work on Perl in 1987, while working as a programmer at Unisys,
and released version 1.0 to the comp.sources.misc newsgroup on December 18, 1987.
 The language expanded rapidly over the next few years.

Perl 2, released in 1988, featured a better regular expression engine. Perl 3, released in 1989, added support for binary data streams.

Originally the only documentation for Perl was a single (increasingly lengthy) man page. In 1991, Programming Perl, known to many Perl programmers 
as the "Camel Book" because of its cover, was published and became the de facto reference for the language. 
At the same time, the Perl version number was bumped to 4, not to mark a major change in the language but to identify the version that was
 well documented by the book. </p>
