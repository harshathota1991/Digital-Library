		<h1 style="color:#151B54;" > About Java  </h1><br>	
		<p>Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, 
		class-based, object-oriented and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. 
		It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" 
		(WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
		Java applications are typically compiled to byte code that can run on any Java virtual machine 
		(JVM) regardless of computer architecture. As of 2015, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use,
		particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.
		Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems
		(which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' 
		Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.

The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, 
and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licences. As of May 2007, 
in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun relicensed most of its Java technologies under
 the GNU General Public License. Others have also developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies,
 such as the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets).</p>

	<h1 style="color:#151B54;" > Principles  </h1><br>		
<p>	There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language</p>	
<ul>
<li><p>It must be "simple, object-oriented and familiar".</p></li>
<li><p>It must be "robust and secure".</p></li>
<li><p>It must be "architecture-neutral and portable".</p></li>
<li><p>It must execute with "high performance".</p></li>
<li><p>It must be "interpreted, threaded, and dynamic".</p></li>
</ul>
		<br><br>
	<h1 style="color:#151B54;" > Performance </h1><br>	
<p> Programs written in Java have a reputation for being slower and requiring more memory than those written in C++.
 However, Java programs' execution speed improved significantly with the introduction of Just-in-time compilation in 1997/1998 for Java 1.1,
 the addition of language features supporting better code analysis (such as inner classes, the StringBuilder class, optional assertions, etc.),
 and optimizations in the Java virtual machine, such as HotSpot becoming the default for Sun's JVM in 2000.
