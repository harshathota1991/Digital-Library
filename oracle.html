		<h1 style="color:#151B54;" > About Oracle Database </h1><br>	
		<p>Oracle Database (commonly referred to as Oracle RDBMS or simply as Oracle) is an object-relational database management system
		produced and marketed by Oracle Corporation. An Oracle database system—identified by an alphanumeric system identifier or SID—comprises at least
		one instance of the application, along with data storage. An instance—identified persistently by an instantiation number
		(or activation id: SYS.V_$DATABASE.ACTIVATION#)—comprises a set of operating-system processes and memory-structures that interact with the storage.
		(Typical processes include PMON (the process monitor) and SMON (the system monitor).) Oracle documentation can refer to an active database
		instance as a "shared memory realm". Users of Oracle databases refer to the server-side memory-structure as the SGA (System Global Area).
		The SGA typically holds cache information such as data-buffers, SQL commands, and user information. In addition to storage,
		the database consists of online redo logs (or logs), which hold transactional history. Processes can in turn archive the online redo 
		logs into archive logs (offline redo logs), which provide the basis (if necessary) for data recovery and for the physical-standby forms of data
		replication using Oracle Data Guard.
</p>

		<br>
		<h1 style="color:#151B54;" > Storage </h1><br>	
		<p>The Oracle RDBMS stores data logically in the form of tablespaces and physically in the form of data files ("datafiles").
		Tablespaces can contain various types of memory segments, such as Data Segments, Index Segments, etc. Segments in turn comprise one or more extents.
		Extents comprise groups of contiguous data blocks. Data blocks form the basic units of data storage.
		The partitioning feature was introduced in Oracle 8. This allows the partitioning of tables based on different set of keys.
		Specific partitions can then be easily added or dropped to help manage large data sets
