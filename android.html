		<h1 style="color:#151B54;" > About Android  </h1><br>	
		<p>Android software development is the process by which new applications are created for the Android operating system. 
		Applications are usually developed in Java programming language using the Android Software Development Kit (SDK), 
		but other development environments are also available.

As of July 2013, more than one million applications have been developed for Android,
 with over 25 billion downloads. A June 2011 research indicated that over 67% of mobile developers used the platform, 
at the time of publication. In Q2 2012, around 105 million units of Android smartphones were shipped which acquires a total share of 68% in overall 
smartphones sale till Q2 2012.</p>

<h3 style="color:#151B54;" > Android SDK </h3><br>		

<p> The Android software development kit (SDK) includes a comprehensive set of development tools.
 These include a debugger, libraries, a handset emulator based on QEMU, documentation, sample code, and tutorials. 
 Currently supported development platforms include computers running Linux (any modern desktop Linux distribution), 
 Mac OS X 10.5.8 or later, and Windows XP or later. As of March 2015,
 the SDK is not available on Android itself, but the software development is possible by using specialized Android applications.</p><br><br>
<h3 style="color:#151B54;" > Android Debug Bridge</h3><br>		
<p>	The Android Debug Bridge (ADB) is a toolkit included in the Android SDK package.
 It consists of both client and server-side programs that communicate with one another. The ADB is typically accessed through the command-line interface, 
although numerous graphical user interfaces exist to control ADB.</p>
